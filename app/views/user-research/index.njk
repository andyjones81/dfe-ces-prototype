User research enables teams to learn about their users, and to create services and policies that meet their needs.

## What user research can help you do

User research can help you to:

- understand the problems you are trying to solve
- decide if a service should be built
- ensure the service that you create will work well for users
- meet the policy intent and business goals

The better you [understand your users](/standards/service-standard/1), the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them, and that meets business goals.
