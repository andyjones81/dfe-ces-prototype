## To meet point 5 of the Service Standard

User researchers must:

- consider the diversity of the end-users
- test with people with access needs
- work with interaction designers to work and test prototypes
- consider the limitations of prototypes when testing with users with access needs

### How you'll be assessed on this

At an alpha assessment assessors will look for:

- how the team is including people with access needs, assisted digital, citizens and members of staff in their research
- understanding of limitations and constraints for testing with users with access needs and have a plan for further testing
- user researchers have worked with content and interaction designers to consider how they might test prototypes with users with access needs 
- where prototypes are not accessible, alternative ways to provide content for the service have been tested
- how you’ve been writing <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">user stories for your service</a> - including for users who need <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/assisted-digital-support-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">assisted digital support</a>
