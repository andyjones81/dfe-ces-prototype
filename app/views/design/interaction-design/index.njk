Interaction designers remove risk by working with user researchers to test ideas early and often with real users. They work closely with the entire project team, especially user researchers, service designers, content designers and software developers.

This is done to make sure the services the Department for Education create are inclusive and accessible and can be used by all people

Interaction design removes the risk of developing systems that don’t meet user needs by:

- testing assumptions, hypothesis, and designs early and often
- ensuring the product is inclusive and accessible

Interaction design along with other disciplines helps us create products that:

- meet the Service Standard
- meet public sector accessibility regulations
- meet current web standards
- meet user and organisational needs
- me simple and intuitive to use
- work in a way that is familiar
- require the minimum possible steps to complete
- are consistent throughout
- are usable by everyone, equally

## When to do it

Interaction design is applicable throughout the agile delivery phases: Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live. 

In addition, Interaction designers work on legacy services and rolling out changes to ensure DfE’s services are consistent and meets current standards and regulations.

## Benefits

Interaction design supports digital delivery to ensure benefits can be realised, this means it:

- reduces risk, development and maintenance costs by testing assumptions and hypothesis
- improves outcomes by facilitating design sessions to ensure a wide range of possibilities are considered
- improves performance and reduces the number of user errors
- increases user satisfaction and trust in both the service and DfE
- improves efficiency through consistency and familiarity
